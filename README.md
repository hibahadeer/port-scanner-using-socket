# üîç Port Scanner Using Socket

This is a simple **port scanner** written in Python using the built-in `socket` module. It allows users to scan a range of ports on a given target IP address to check which ports are open or closed.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. The script takes an IP address and a range of ports from the user.  
2. It attempts to connect to each port in the specified range using TCP.  
3. If the connection is successful, the port is considered **open**.  
4. If the connection fails, the port is **closed**.  
5. Results are printed to the console.

## üß† How It Works

1. The script takes an IP address and a range of ports from the user.  
2. It attempts to connect to each port in the specified range using TCP.  
3. If the connection is successful, the port is considered **open**.  
4. If the connection fails, the port is **closed**.  
5. Results are printed to the console.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Save the script as `port_scanner.py`.  
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
